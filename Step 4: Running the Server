Install Node.js and Express:

Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, download and install it from Node.js official website.
In your project directory, run the following commands to install Express and body-parser:
bash
Copy code
npm init -y
npm install express body-parser
Start the Server:

In your project directory, run:
bash
Copy code
node server.js
Open the HTML File:

Open index.html in your web browser.
Submit the Form:

Fill out the form and submit it. You should see the response displayed on the page.
Explanation
HTML Form:

A simple form with username and email fields. When the form is submitted, it prevents the default form submission and uses JavaScript to send the data.
JavaScript (main.js):

Listens for the form submission event, gathers the form data, and sends it to the server using the Fetch API.
Displays the response message on the page.
Node.js Server:

Uses Express to create a simple server that listens for POST requests on the /submit endpoint.
Parses the JSON request body and sends a JSON response with the received data.
This hands-on lab demonstrates the basics of making HTTP requests and handling responses using HTML, JavaScript, and a Node.js server. You can extend this lab by adding more features, such as form validation, error handling, and connecting to a database.
